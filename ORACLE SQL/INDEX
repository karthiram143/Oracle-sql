INDEX:
It is used to improve the performance of the query or used
To reduce the cost of the query
-- ex:
SELECT first_ame, salaryfrm employewhere first_name='David';
-- check ins
1.syntactic check- to like from (oracle reserved keyword check) 
2.sematic check - to like 1st check table name,  column names-under the column like to check with right with left check 
ex:salary value is checking if ok it go next in first_name column
3. full scan - If the no index is there it check full scanchecking the CPU cost to checkin scaning using the code
SELECT * FROM c$sql_plan;
 here is lot of data we need to get the v$sql id need to take
--  using
SELECT * FROM V$SQL 
WHERE SQL_TET LIKE ('SELECT first_Name, salaryfr0m employee%');- I am getting sql_id
after 
select * from v$sql_plan where sql_id='dqwvdgwdck6z'; 
TYPE:
 1.B-tree index
 2.bitmap index
 3.composite index
 4.unique index
 5.function based index
 6.index organized table

                --    1.B-tree Index:
1.balanced tree index,(ie) it is an ordered list of values that are divided into range associated with rowed
2.it is crated on high cardinality columns.
-- SYN:
Create INDEX index_name on table_name)column_name);
-- ex:(BEFORE CREATING INDEX)
select FIRST_NAME,SALARY from employee
WHERE FIRST_NAME	='David'

SELECT * FROM V$SQL_PLAN-- CHECK THE COST

SELECT * FROM V$SQL WHERE SQL_TEXT LIKE ('select FIRST_NAME,SALARY from employee
WHERE FIRST_NAME	=''David''%') -- Based on the sql ID TO check the plan after
-- after
SELECT * FROM V$SQL_PLAN where sql_id='depqlsmedmza;'-- here i can able to see the cost
-- RESULT:(ITS SCAN FULL)
COST:3
-- after creating the index
CREATE INDEX INDEX_EMPLOYEE ON EMPLOYEE(FIRST_NAME);--CREATED
-- To checking the what are index are created in this schema
SELECT * FROM user_indexes where TABLE_NAME='EMPLOYEE'
-- RESULT:
INDEX_NAME	INDEX_TYPE	TABLE_OWNER	TABLE_NAME	TABLE_TYPE	UNIQUENESS	COMPRESSION	PREFIX_LENGTH	TABLESPACE_NAME
-- or other To checking the what are index are created in this schema
SELECT * FROM USER_IND_COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME='EMPLOYEE'
-- RESULT:
INDEX_NAME	TABLE_NAME	COLUMN_NAME	COLUMN_POSITION	COLUMN_LENGTH	CHAR_LENGTH	DESCEND	COLLATED_COLUMN_ID
INDEX_EMPLOYEE	EMPLOYEE	FIRST_NAME	1	50	50	ASC	-

-- AFTER RUNING THE QUERY GIVE THE SAME RESULT:
select FIRST_NAME,SALARY from employee
WHERE FIRST_NAME	='David'

-- RUN THE TO CHECK THE COST
SELECT * FROM V$SQL_PLAN where sql_id='depqlsmedmza;'
-- RESULT:(RANGE SCAN)
COST:1 --TO PERFOMANCE TUING

--** AFTER creating index - it doing asedning to go directly in that place to show the result
SELECT FIRST_NAME FROM EMPLOYEE order by FIRST_NAME asc; --its copying the table

B-TREE STRUCTURE (Employee Names)

                    Emp name A-Z
                   /           \
             A-M                     N-Z
           /     \                 /     \
       A-F       G-M           N-S       T-Z
      /  \      /   \         /   \     /   \
   Rowid Rowid Rowid Rowid Rowid Rowid Rowid Rowid
Explanation:
Root node → Emp name A-Z (top of tree)

Branch nodes → A-M and N-Z (split ranges)

Leaf nodes → A-F, G-M, N-S, T-Z → point to actual ROWIDs

ROWIDs → references to table rows in sorted order
