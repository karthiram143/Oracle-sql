                 -- SET OPERATORS
A set operator is used to combine the result of two or more queries into a single result.
-- type:
1.union
2.Union all
3.intersect
4.minus
-- RULES:
1. Each query will have at least two select statements that are separated by a set operators
2. Must have the same number of columns and same data type on every query
3. If using aggregate function , all select statements much have their own group by clause
4. ALL SELECT statement must have a separate from clause
5. The first SELECT statement  is used for all ALIAS and format statements
6. The last select will have the order by clause
7. Duplicate rows are eliminated unless the all keyword is used
-- EX:
SELECT FIRST_NAME,SALARY 
FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY=(SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE)
UNION
SELECT FIRST_NAME , SALARY 
FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY=(SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE)
-- RESULT:
FIRST_NAME	SALARY
James	47000
Matthew	75000
--  IF DONT WANT TO COLUMN FOR 2ND SELECT USE NULL
SELECT FIRST_NAME,SALARY 
FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY=(SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE)
UNION
SELECT FIRST_NAME , NULL -- HERE YOU MAY PUT NULL IF YOU WANT 
FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY=(SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE)
-- RESULT:
FIRST_NAME	SALARY

 5TH RULE:
 --  IF DONT WANT TO COLUMN FOR 2ND SELECT USE NULL
SELECT FIRST_NAME,SALARY 
FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY=(SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE)
UNION
SELECT FIRST_NAME , SALARY AS SAL
FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY=(SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE)
-- RESULT: IT NOT TAKEN THE ALIAS COLUMN NEED TO GIVEN 1ST SEELCT SATEMENT
FIRST_NAME	SALARY
James	47000
Matthew	75000

-- 6TH RULE--
SELECT FIRST_NAME,SALARY 
FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY=(SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE)
ORDER BY FIRST_NAME ASC--IT SHOULD BE COME AT LAST
UNION
SELECT FIRST_NAME , SALARY AS SAL
FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY=(SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE)
-- RESULT: (IT WORKS)
SELECT FIRST_NAME,SALARY 
FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY=(SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE)
UNION
SELECT FIRST_NAME , SALARY AS SAL
FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY=(SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE)
ORDER BY FIRST_NAME ASC--IT SHOULD BE COME AT LAST

---UNION 
  1.It returns only the unique/ distinct result.  
  2. Output will be sorted by default   
 3. UNION is often slower than union all ,because there is an operation to remove duplicate values , which is often a costly step in a query
  4. Not suitable for performance turning bcoz it remove duplicat records  syn: SELECT QUERY1
UNION 
SELCT QUERY-2

EX:
Select * from set_op1 --10
union— it remove the duplicate both data is matches means any one query match is removed 1st query 3 records , 2nd query 3 records is removed only one 3 
select from set_op2; --8
RESULT:
 10+5=15
---- UNION ALL
  1.It returns all records from all the query  
  2. Output will not sorted by default   
  3. It will not remove the duplicate records
  4. suitable for performance turning bcoz it does not remove duplicate records and sorting 
  5. Union all is usually faster than union because it not not perform any duplicate removal  
--syn: 
SELECT QUERY1
UNION ALL
SELCT QUERY-2

EX:
Select * from set_op1   — 8 
UNION ALL                      — IT GET ALL THE DATA
select from set_op2  —10
RESULT:
IT GIVE -10+8=18

           ---- INSERSECT
  1.It returns all The common records from all the query   
  2. Output will  sorted by default   
  3. It will remove the duplicate records
 --syn:
 SELECT QUERY1
INTERSECT
SELCT QUERY-2

EX:
Select * from set_op1   — 8 
INTERSECT                      — IT GET MACTHING DATA  
select from set_op2    —10
RESULT:—3     only matching records so give me only match data fro both table
IT GIVE -10(3)+8(3)= 3


     ---  MINUS
MINUS
  1.It returns all The  records from one query excluding the records from the other query result.  
  2. Output will be sorted by default 
  3. It will remove the duplicate records 
 syn: 
SELECT QUERY1
MINUS
SELCT QUERY-2

EX:
Select * from set_op1 
MINUS                      — Remove matching values and to show the set_p1 table data only 
select from set_op2 
or 
Select * from set_op2 
MINUS                      — Remove matching values and to show the set_p2 table data only 
select from set_op1
