-- result:
FIRST_NAME	SALARY
Jane	62000
Emily	72000
-- (using sub query final query)
-- this kind of result i need to acchive in a single query use the sub query
SELECT FIRST_NAME,SALARY FROM EMPLOYEE 
WHERE SALARY >(SELECT SALARY 
              FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE FIRST_NAME='Betty');

-- (sub query greater than 3 is 72000
-- SALARY 72000,61000,56000)
SELECT FIRST_NAME,SALARY FROM EMPLOYEE 
WHERE SALARY > '72000'; --AS LIKE 
-- FINAL QUERY
SELECT FIRST_NAME,SALARY FROM EMPLOYEE 
WHERE SALARY > ALL (SELECT SALARY

select column1,columns,(select column from t form ) from table
-- example
SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE; --47000
SELECT Max(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE; --75000
-- sub query
 SELECT FIRST_NAME ,(SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID='30')AS MIN_SALRY,SALARY,
 (SELECT Max(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID='20')AS MAX_SALARY 
 FROM EMPLOYEE
 WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID='10'

rownum=1, rownum <15 its works

SELECT ROWNUM, e.* from EMPLOYEE E
-- to achive the rownum=5 
--  final query
SELECT RN, FIRST_NAME,EMPLOYEE_ID 
FROM (SELECT ROWNUM AS RN, e.* from EMPLOYEE E order by EMPLOYEE_ID asc) G
WHERE RN=5
